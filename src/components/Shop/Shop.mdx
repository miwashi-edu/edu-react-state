# Shop

The `Shop` component is a container that loads products and renders an item layout. It expects a single child component (typically `Item`) which is cloned and enriched with product data and an `onAdd` callback.

## Data Fetching

Products are fetched from `/api/products.json`. If no products are returned, the shop shows an empty state.

## Cloning and Injection

Each product is passed to a clone of the single `children` element with:

- `...product` (spread)
- `onAdd`: calls `onAddToCart(product)`

This allows wrapping containers like `CartWithStorage` to manage cart logic via prop injection.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Default">
    <Shop />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

// ---
// The Shop component is designed to be agnostic of cart state and logic.
// It focuses solely on displaying products and handling UI interactions.
// Cart logic is provided by parent components or HOCs, keeping Shop clean and reusable.
// ---

## With Cart and Item

// In this example, the CartWithTestStorage HOC wraps Shop and provides all cart logic.
// Shop only needs to know how to call onAdd when a product is added.

```jsx
import { Shop } from './components/Shop';
import { CartWithTestStorage } from './components/Cart';
import { Item } from './components/Items';

<CartWithTestStorage>
  <Shop>
    <Item />
  </Shop>
</CartWithTestStorage>
```

<Canvas>
  <Story name="With Test Storage">
    <ShopStories.WithCartAndItem />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

// The following examples show how different HOCs can provide cart logic using various storage mechanisms.
// This demonstrates the flexibility and composability of the HOC pattern.

## Other Storage Examples

### Local Storage

```jsx
import { CartWithLocalStorage } from './components/Cart';

<CartWithLocalStorage>
  <Shop>
    <Item />
  </Shop>
</CartWithLocalStorage>
```

### Backend Storage

```jsx
import { CartWithBackend } from './components/Cart';

<CartWithBackend>
  <Shop>
    <Item />
  </Shop>
</CartWithBackend>
```

## Custom Item Component

You may swap in a more detailed item view:

```jsx
import { ItemWithImage } from './components/Items';

<CartWithTestStorage>
  <Shop>
    <ItemWithImage />
  </Shop>
</CartWithTestStorage>
```
