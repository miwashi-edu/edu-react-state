# Shop

The `Shop` component is a container that loads products and renders an item layout. It expects a single child component (typically `Item`) which is cloned and enriched with product data and an `onAdd` callback.

## Data Fetching

Products are fetched from `/api/products.json`. If no products are returned, the shop shows an empty state.

## Cloning and Injection

Each product is passed to a clone of the single `children` element with:

- `...product` (spread)
- `onAdd`: calls `onAddToCart(product)`

This allows wrapping containers like `CartWithStorage` to manage cart logic via prop injection.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Default">
    <Shop />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## With Cart and Item

This setup demonstrates interaction between `Shop`, `Cart`, and `Item` using a higher-order cart wrapper.

```jsx
import { Shop } from './components/Shop';
import { CartWithTestStorage } from './components/Cart';
import { Item } from './components/Items';

<CartWithTestStorage>
  <Shop>
    <Item />
  </Shop>
</CartWithTestStorage>
```

<Canvas>
  <Story name="With Test Storage">
    <ShopStories.WithCartAndItem />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Other Storage Examples

### Local Storage

```jsx
import { CartWithLocalStorage } from './components/Cart';

<CartWithLocalStorage>
  <Shop>
    <Item />
  </Shop>
</CartWithLocalStorage>
```

### Backend Storage

```jsx
import { CartWithBackend } from './components/Cart';

<CartWithBackend>
  <Shop>
    <Item />
  </Shop>
</CartWithBackend>
```

## Custom Item Component

You may swap in a more detailed item view:

```jsx
import { ItemWithImage } from './components/Items';

<CartWithTestStorage>
  <Shop>
    <ItemWithImage />
  </Shop>
</CartWithTestStorage>
```
