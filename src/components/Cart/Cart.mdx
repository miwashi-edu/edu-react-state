# Cart

The `Cart` component wraps your application content and provides a shopping cart interface with toggle and remove functionality. It supports both controlled and uncontrolled modes for cart visibility and delegates item management through props.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Default">
    <Cart items={[{ name: 'Apple', price: 1 }, { name: 'Banana', price: 2 }]} onRemove={() => {}}>
      <div>Shop content goes here</div>
    </Cart>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

// ---
// This Cart component is intentionally stateless. All cart state and logic are injected via Higher-Order Components (HOCs).
// This design is for educational purposes, to demonstrate how HOCs can manage state and inject it into presentational components.
// ---
## Usage with HOC

// Each HOC below manages the cart's state using a different storage mechanism (local, backend, memory, or test data).
// The HOC wraps the Cart and injects state and handlers as props, keeping Cart itself stateless and reusable.

### Local Storage

// withLocalStorage manages cart state in the browser's local storage and injects it into Cart.

```jsx
import withLocalStorage from './withLocalStorage';
import Cart from './Cart';
import Shop from '../Shop';

const LocalCart = withLocalStorage(Cart);

<LocalCart>
  <Shop />
</LocalCart>
```

### Backend Storage

// withBackend manages cart state by syncing with a backend API and injects it into Cart.

```jsx
import withBackend from './withBackend';
import Cart from './Cart';
import Shop from '../Shop';

const BackendCart = withBackend(Cart);

<BackendCart>
  <Shop />
</BackendCart>
```

### Transient (Memory) Storage

// withTransientStorage manages cart state in memory (not persisted) and injects it into Cart.

```jsx
import withTransientStorage from './withTransientStorage';
import Cart from './Cart';
import Shop from '../Shop';

const MemoryCart = withTransientStorage(Cart);

<MemoryCart>
  <Shop />
</MemoryCart>
```

### Test Storage (Static Initial Data)

// withTestStorage provides static test data for the cart, useful for demos and testing.

```jsx
import withTestStorage from './withTestStorage';
import Cart from './Cart';
import Shop from '../Shop';

const TestCart = withTestStorage(Cart);

<TestCart>
  <Shop />
</TestCart>
```

## Prop Injection

// HOCs use React.cloneElement to inject the onAddToCart handler into children, allowing any child (like Shop) to interact with the cart without knowing about its implementation.
// This pattern keeps components decoupled and focused on their own responsibilities.

## Notes

- The cart can be **controlled** using `open`/`setOpen` or **uncontrolled** using internal state.
- Removal uses `onRemove(index)`; items must be stored with a consistent order.
